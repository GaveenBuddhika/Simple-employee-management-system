## Employee Management System

## This project implements a simple employee management system using the following technologies:

Backend: Spring Boot
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap


## Features
Add Employee: Create new employee profiles with essential details.
Edit Employee: Modify existing employee information.
Search Employee: Find employees by criteria (e.g., name, ID).
Delete Employee: Remove employee records (with confirmation).
Data Persistence: Store employee data securely in a MySQL database.
Duplicate Prevention: Enforce unique employee IDs to avoid data inconsistencies.
Exception Handling: Gracefully manage potential errors during data operations.


## Getting Started

## Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
  ```bash
  https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
   ```
- Maven
  ```bash
  https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  ```
- MySQL ```bash
  https://www.mysql.com/
  ```database server
- Code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)


## Clone the Repository:
- Bash
- git clone
  ```bash
  https://github.com/<GaveenBuddhika>/Simple-employee-management-system.git
   ```
- Use code with caution.


## Set Up Database:
- Create a MySQL database named employee_management_system (or adjust the configuration in src/main/resources/application.properties).
- Ensure you have the necessary database credentials (username, password).


## Configure Spring Boot:
- Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your database connection details.


## Run the Application:
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Run mvn spring-boot:run to start the application.
- Frontend Development:

## Frontend Code:
- The frontend code resides in the src/main/resources/static directory.
- Use Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling.
- Implement JavaScript logic for user interaction (e.g., form submission, data fetching, validation).

## API Integration:
- The frontend will interact with Spring Boot REST APIs for CRUD operations.
- Consider using a framework like Axios for HTTP requests.


## Additional Considerations:

- Security: For production use, implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect employee data.
- Error Handling: Provide user-friendly messages for any errors encountered during operations.
- Testing: Write unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend components to ensure system reliability.
- Deployment: Explore packaging the application as a JAR file and deploying it to a server for production use (e.g., Spring Boot Actuator for health checks).

## Disclaimer
- This README provides a general structure. You'll need to fill in the specific details for your project, such as setting up the frontend development environment and integrating the frontend with the Spring Boot APIs.
